# VWX-Slab-Style-Assistant-Two-Step-Workflow-
Two Vectorworks Python scripts for Slab Styles. Script 1 counts imported styles and draws a grid of 1×1 m rectangles (one per style); you then convert them to slabs via AEC → Create Objects from Shapes. Script 2 assigns styles one‑to‑one to the selected slabs, using exclusive selection and post‑change verification
